this is just to get some kind of idea of what i want to do with pantry checker. 

some things i want it to do:
keep a list that it can add to like a current pantry and fridge lists 
have a first time sequence if the lists are empty
have seperate lists for the refrigerator and the pantry as well as cleaning items

I have taken some code advice from gemini and i wrote it into the file. i asked it 
to not write it all for me as i want to practice writing this out myself, but i have
become a bit stuck, so i think i will shelf this for now and begin my python courses
and read my book until i gain a better understanding of what it is im trying to do 
here.
